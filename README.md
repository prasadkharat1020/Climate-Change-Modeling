# 🌍 Climate Change Modeling

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for data analysis and interactive development  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – for code editing and version control

## 💻 Technologies
- **Machine Learning**  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy**  

## 📈 Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to model and predict climate change patterns such as temperature rise, CO₂ concentration, and extreme weather events. The goal is to provide accurate forecasts and support awareness and policy-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and analyze historical climate data  
- Train ML models to forecast climate trends  
- Visualize future predictions  
- Understand feature importance and model interpretability

## 🧪 Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Time-Series Models (ARIMA, LSTM)

## 📊 Data Sources
- NASA Global Climate Data  
- NOAA Climate Datasets  
- Kaggle Climate Datasets

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run `climate_model.ipynb` for model training and visualization
